  This page is intentionally sparse. There are two reasons:
  <br>
  <br>
  <p class="dark_gray">
    Firstly, my career has been as a firefighter. I have spent most of my
    working life overseas as a contractor at locations as diverse as a science
    station in Antarctica to military defense contracts in support and service
    of the Dept. of Defense in Iraq and Afghanistan. While my focus was
    obviously on life, health and safety of the commmunities in which I serve,
    I have gravitated to self-study in IT since I was young, and regularly
    infused IT functionality into every day applications within the fire
    service. This includes:
  </p>
  <br>
  <ul class="dark_gray">
    <li>Barcode scanning for tracking of fire extinguisher monthly
      inspections</li>
    <li>Trackers to build more efficient training programs</li>
    <li>Extensive self study in MS Visual Basic for deep dives into Excel
      macro coding with numerous applications to streamline work flow in
      record keeping and other station duties</li>
  </ul>
  While these served me well in my work, the efforts I put in did not actively
  promote the career change I am seeking.
  <br>
  <p class="dark_gray">
    Secondly and because of this, I have yet to build an IT resume. While I
    feel that I have strong talents and inclinations toward programming, this
    is nonetheless a mid-life career transition that has yet to be
    'credentialed'. I am working diligently to build the skill sets I need
    to suceed in this career transition, and this biography page will be
    amended as those credentials are realized.
