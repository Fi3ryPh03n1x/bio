    <h2>Hi.</h2><br><br>
    <img class="icon_3" src="images\icon_3.png" alt="Avatar">

    <p class="body_text">
      I'm Mark, a budding IT professional. "Budding" because I haven't always
      been in IT. I'm a firefighter by trade, primarily working on various
      science- and military-based contracts throughout the world. Seriously,
      I've been everywhere from Alaska to Antarctica, war-torn Iraq to
      beautiful, tropical Marshalese islands in the South Pacific. And that
      isn't even counting the vacations!
      <br><br>
      <img class="firehose" src="images\firehose.png" alt="firehose">
      <br><br>
      But the time has come for me to hang the helmet and get serious about a
      vocation change. While firefighting is great, I've always loved IT, and
      have incorporated technology and programming into my work everywhere I go.
      (I'll leave the boring details to the <a class="menu" href="cv.html">CV
      </a>.) Since I was very young, I was exposed to computer technology as
      early as the Commodore 64 and the Atari 2600! (Those are real,
      look 'em' up!) And I've been tinkering inside of machines ever since.
      <br><br>

      <br><br>
      I'll be updating this page periodically as I gain experience and IT
      credentials. Right now, it's all about Python. This page is here because
      of a project in a 100-Day Bootcamp. I'm about halfway through, and I
      couldn't be happier about the investment I'm making. I think I was born
      to be a programmer! But I of course have plans for ongoing training and
      hope to be in the job market soon.

      Anyway, thanks so much for stopping in. I'd love to
      <a class="menu" href="contact.html">hear from you</a> if you
      have any questions or just want to say "hey"! Be well!
