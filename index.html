  <h1><em>Mark Burns</em></h1>
  <p><em>Aspiring new <strong>Software Engineer</strong></em></p>
  <p>
    I am a budding Python coder, working my way through a 100-day coding bootcamp.

  <p>
    This page is intentionally sparse. There are two reasons:
    <br>
    <br>
    Firstly, my career has been as a firefighter. I have spent most of my working life
    overseas, working as a contractor at locations as diverse as a science station in
    Antarctica to military defense contracts in support and service of the Dept. of Defense.
    While my focus was obviously on life, health and safety of the commmunities in which
    I serve, I have gravitated to self-study in IT since I was young, and regularly
    infused IT functionality into every day applications within the fire service. This includes:
    <br>
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Barcode scanning for tracking of fire extinguisher monthly inspections</li>
    <li>Trackers to build more efficient training programs</li>
    <li>Extensive self study in MS Visual Basic for deep dives into Excel macro coding
      with numerous applications to streamline work flow in record keeping and other station duties</li>
  </ul>
  While these served me well in my work, the efforts I put in did not actively promote the career change I am seeking.
  <br>
  <p>
    Secondly and because of this, I have yet to build an IT resume. While I feel that I have strong talents and
    inclinations toward programming, this is nonetheless a mid-life career transition that
    has yet to be 'credentialed'. I am working diligently to build the skill sets I need
    to suceed in this career transition, and this biography page will be amended as those
    credentials are realized.
